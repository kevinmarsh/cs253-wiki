CS 253 Wiki
----------

Here's a wiki that I'm in the process of building in [Udacity CS253](http://www.udacity.com/course/cs253). Very simplistic and obviously a work in progress It's built in Python with Jinga2 as the framework, runs well on GAE.

A working version is running on [Google App Engine](https://backburnerdev.appspot.com/wiki)

Still to add:
* admin class for users to allow posting/editing privleges
* page history
* link user and post entities together
